# dualmarker
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

*Dualmarker* is designed for data exploration and hypothesis generation for dual biomarkers. It provides intuitive visualizations and extensive assessment of two marker combinations using logistic regression model for binary outcome (response analysis) and Cox regression for time-to-event outcome (survival analysis). It performs dual marker analysis via two distinct modules, one for evaluation of specific biomarker pair through *dm_pair* function, which comprehensively reveals the correlation among two markers, response and survival using over 14 sub-plots,such as boxplots, scatterplots, ROCs, and Kaplan-Meier plots. Another  module is de-novo identification and prioritization of marker2 among candidate markers in combination with known marker1 to predict response and survival through *dm_searchM2_cox* and *dm_searchM2_logit* function, its expansion version works for all biomarker combination to prioritize the most significant pair through *dm_combM_cox* and *dm_combM_logit* function. It is applicable for both response and survival analyses and compatible with both continuous and categorical variables. This figure illustrates the framework of this package.

## Key functions

Plenty of commands and functions are wrapped into five main functions: *dm_pair* for visualization and statistics of given dual marker pairs, *dm_searchM2_cox* and *dm_searchM2_logit* for de novo identification of novel marker2 to combine with marker1 using Cox survival model and logistic regression model.


### *dm_pair*
*dm_pair* is the main function for dual marker visualization and statistics. It takes the marker1, marker2, response or survival as input, and returns plots (response.plot, survival.plot) and statistic results (response.stats, survival.stats) from logistic regression for binary outcome(response) and Cox regression for time-to-event outcome(survival) . The detailed results are shown in the following structure:

+ response.plot
   - boxplot
   - scatter.chart
   - four.quadrant
   - roc
+ response.stats
   - logit
   - four.quadrant
      - param
      - stats
+ survival.plot
   - km.m1m2
   - scatter.m1m2
   - km.dualmarker
   - km.dualmarker.facet
   - scatter.dualmarker
   - four.quadrant
+ survival.stats
   - cox
   - four.quadrant
      - param
      - stats

### *dm_searchM2_cox/logit*
These two functions are the main functions for do novo identification of marker2 to combine with marker1. It takes marker1, and m2.candidates, optional covariates, response or time/event as input and returns the statistical result of Cox or logistic regression model. 
Four regression models are built using single marker and dual marker w/ or w/o interaction term, as follows: 

+ model1: Surv/Resp ~ marker1 + covariates, labeled as 'SM1' for short
+ model2: Surv/Resp ~ marker2 + covariates , labeled as 'SM2' for short
+ model3: Surv/Resp ~ marker1 + marker2 + covariates, labeled as 'DM' for short, i.e. dual-marker
+ model4: Surv/Resp ~ marker1 * marker2 (with interaction term) + covariates, labeled as 'DMI' for short, i.e. dual-marker with interaction

Model comparison is performed to test the difference of dual-marker model and single-marker model by Likihood ratio test(LRT) using *anova* function for SM1-vs-DM, SM1-vs-DMI, SM2-vs-DM, SM2-vs-DMI.
*dm_searchM2_topPlot* can facilitate the glance of top candidate marker2s for both logistic and cox regression model.

The statistics of logistic regression contains the basic information of marker1, marker2, covariates, response, time, event; the estimate and p-values from 4 models, AUC(for logistic regression)/ concordant probability CPE(for Cox regression), AIC, p-values of model comparisons. Here is an example of logistic regression:

## dataset
We demonstrate the package using [Imvigor210](http://research-pub.gene.com/IMvigor210CoreBiologies) biomarker data. This dataset includes the baseline characterization of PDL1 IHC, gene expression profiling(GEP) and mutations on 348 advanced UC patients as well as response and Overall survival(OS) data treated by Atezolizumab. The demographic info, clinical efficacy and biomarker data is stored in **clin_bmk_IMvigor210** dataframe, with gene expression variables containing 'gep_' prefix, gene signature score  variables containing 'gepscore_' prefix and mutation variables containing 'mut_' prefix. The GEP data and gene signature score is processed according to the IMvigor210CoreBiologies package and gene signature score is calculated using *hallmark* genesets from MsigDBv7.0 as well as signatures from the IMvigor210CoreBiologies package. The data is confirmed with the original publication.

## Example1: marker pair of TMB + TGF-beta signature

Here we demonstrate the response analysis of TMB + TGF-beta gene signature(gepscore_TGFb.19gene) using *dm_pair* function. This pair of biomarker is studied in [Nature.2018 Feb 22;554(7693):544-548](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29443960/). The *response* should be dichotomous by setting *response.pos* and *response.neg* values.

'm1_m2_effect' is scatter-plot, showing the log10-pValue of model comparison, i.e. dual-vs-marker1 and dual-vs-marker2. Dual model that superior to both marker1 and marker2 is preferred, located top-right on the figure.
```{r,fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot.m2.cox$m1_m2_effect
```

* plot-4: CPE 
'CPE' is concordant probability to evaluate the performance of Cox model using CPE package
```{r,fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
plot.m2.cox$CPE
```

* stats: cox result  
this shows the same information with *res_pair$survival.stats$cox* or *res_pair$response.stats$logit*
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(res.m2.cox)
```

top 10 dual marker models with the highest concordant probability(CPE), i.e. best performance of Cox model
```{r, result = "asis"}
res.m2.cox %>% 
   dplyr::arrange(desc(DM_CPE)) %>% 
   dplyr::select(m1, m2, DM_CPE) %>%
   head(10) %>% 
   knitr::kable()
```

## Example4: evaluation for all combinations
*dm_combineM_logit* and *dm_combineM_cox* will evaluate all combinations of dual-markers. We demonstrate with only 4 biomarkers.

```{r}
m.candidates <- c("TMB", "gep_CD274","gep_CXCL13", "gepscore_TGFb.19gene", "mut_ARID1A")
res.combineM.logit <- dm_combineM_logit(
   data = clin_bmk_IMvigor210, 
   response = "binaryResponse", 
   response.pos = "CR/PR",
   response.neg = "SD/PD", 
   candidates = m.candidates,
   m.binarize = F
   )
```

* glimpse of the result
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(res.combineM.logit)
```

Top 2 dual-marker with the highest AUC, i.e. best performance of logistic regression. 
Users can filter and get interesting dual-marker pairs using plenty of statistics and model performance metrics, for example, AUC for response analysis (logistic regression), concordant probability CPE for survival analysis (Cox regression), p-value of dual-vs-single model comparison and statistical interaction of two markers.

```{r}
res.combineM.logit %>% 
   arrange(desc(DM_auc)) %>%
   dplyr::select(m1, m2, DM_auc) %>%
   head(2) %>% 
   knitr::kable()
```
