Description: A package for dual marker analysis of response and survival data. dualmarker is designed to 
  facilitate the data mining of dual biomarkers. It provides intuitive visualizations and extensive assessment 
  of two marker combinations using logistic regression model for binary response outcome and Cox models for
  survival analysis. It performs dual marker analysis via two distinct modules, one for evaluation of specific
  biomarker pair through dm_pair function, it comprehensively reveals the correlation among two markers, response
  and survival using over 14 sub-plots. Another module is de novo identification and prioritization of marker2
  among all candidate markers in combination with known marker1 to predict response and survival through 
  dm_searchM2_cox and dm_searchM2_logit function. Both modules areapplicable for both survival and response analyses 
  and compatible with both continuous and categorical variables.
