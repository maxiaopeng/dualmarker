Description: *Dualmarker* is designed for data exploration and hypothesis generation for dual biomarkers. 
  It provides intuitive visualizations and extensive assessment of two marker combinations using logistic 
  regression model for binary outcome (response analysis) and Cox regression for time-to-event outcome 
  (survival analysis). It performs dual marker analysis via two distinct modules, one for evaluation of
  specific biomarker pair through *dm_pair* function, which comprehensively reveals the correlation among
  two markers, response and survival using over 14 sub-plots,such as boxplots, scatterplots, ROCs, and 
  Kaplan-Meier plots. Another  module is de-novo identification and prioritization of marker2 among 
  candidate markers in combination with known marker1 to predict response and survival through 
  *dm_searchM2_cox* and *dm_searchM2_logit* function, its expansion version works for all biomarker 
  combination to prioritize the most significant pair through *dm_combM_cox* and *dm_combM_logit* function. 
  It is applicable for both response and survival analyses and compatible with both continuous and 
  categorical variables.
